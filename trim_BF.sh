#This script does trim the adapters
module load fastp

#######USING THE TEMPORARY DIRECTORY

#Every job has a temporary directory.
#The automatic variable for the temporary directory is $TMPDIR.

#We need to move any files we want to use into the $TMPDIR.

cp ./renamed/*fastq.gz $TMPDIR
#This command copies all files for trimming into the $TMPDIR.
#The same as any files used in a loop.

pushd $TMPDIR
#This will take or "push" you to the temporary directory.
module load fastp

#UNZIPPING IS NOT NECESSARY FOR FASTP - works with either zipped or unzipped fastq files
for r1_file in ./*-R1.fastq.gz; do
    # Extract sample name from R1 file
    sample_name=$(basename "$r1_file" | cut -f1 -d '-')

    echo "Processing $sample_name"

    # Generate R2 file name
    r2_file="${sample_name}-R2.fastq.gz"

    # Check if the R2 file exists
    if [[ -f "$r2_file" ]]; then
        # Run fastp for paired-end reads
        fastp -i "$r1_file" -I "$r2_file" \
              --out1 "${sample_name}-R1_trimmed.fastq.gz" \

#The loop is done.
#The temporary directory now contains all files that were copied in and all files that were ouput from the loop.
#In this script, output files include trimmed files and summary files.

popd
#Moves or "pops" you back into the folder you were before the pushd command.
#All created files are still in temporary directory.

#Copies any needed files from temporary directory to where you want them.

rm -rf $TMPDIR
#Completely removes temporary directory.
#If you don't do this, I think it lasts for 3 days and is then deleted.
#But I am not sure.
